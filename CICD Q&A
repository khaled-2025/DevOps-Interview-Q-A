CICD:

What is a CI/CD pipeline security best practice?

Answer: Security best practices include:

- Using secrets management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) for sensitive data.
- Scanning code and dependencies for vulnerabilities during the build process.
- Enforcing RBAC and least privilege access for build and deployment systems.
- Using secure artifact repositories to store build outputs.
=========================================================
Q: How do you ensure that your CI/CD pipeline is secure?
A:

- Use Secret Management Tools: Store sensitive information securely.
- Implement Access Controls: Limit who can trigger builds and deploy to production.
- Code Scanning: Integrate static and dynamic code analysis tools into the pipeline.
- Audit Logs: Maintain logs for all pipeline activities for auditing.
