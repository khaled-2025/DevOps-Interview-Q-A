AWS Cloud Platform: 
=========================================================
Q: what is the Difference between IAM Role and IAM User.
A:

IAM Role: Used for granting permissions to AWS services (e.g., EC2, Lambda) or users from other AWS accounts. Itâ€™s ideal for temporary credentials.
IAM User: A permanent identity with a set of credentials for managing AWS resources. Use roles for services or cross-account access; use users for individuals who need AWS management console access.

Vertical vs. Horizontal Scaling in AWS?
A:

- Vertical Scaling: Adding more resources (e.g., CPU, RAM) to a single instance (e.g., moving from a t2.micro to t2.large).
- Horizontal Scaling: Adding more instances of the same resource type (e.g., launching multiple t2.micro instances in an Auto Scaling group).
Implementation: Use Auto Scaling for horizontal scaling; for vertical scaling, resize the instance type.
=========================================================
Question: How do you ensure high availability and scalability in cloud environments?

Answer: High availability and scalability are achieved by using:

- Auto-scaling groups to automatically adjust the number of instances based on load.
- Load balancers to distribute traffic across multiple instances.
- Multi-region deployments to ensure availability even in case of a regional failure.
- Managed services like managed databases or serverless computing (e.g., AWS Lambda) for scalability.
